# ROS2 Nodes Project

This time you will make a project about publisher and subscriber in ROS2 Humble. You are free to make any kind of publisher and subscriber but make sure your nodes can communicate each other. You also have a freedom to choose either Python or C++ language to make your nodes. The more creative and functional the nodes, higher grade will be yours.

Lastly, submit your ROS2 workspace in the task submition card at the right end of this Trello workspace.

Format submition: your_name_ros2_ws.zip
